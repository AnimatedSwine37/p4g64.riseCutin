A mod for Persona 4 Golden PC (64-bit version) that adds a cutin when Rise uses her assist skills in battle.

Currently this does not include when Rise blocks an attack or revives you. Only when giving buffs/healing. I'd like to look into adding a cutin for the block and revive later on though (see the [Issue](https://github.com/AnimatedSwine37/p4g64.riseCutin/issues/1) for this).
