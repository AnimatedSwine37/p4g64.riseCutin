# Rise Cutins

A mod for Persona 4 Golden PC (64-bit version) that adds a cutin when Rise uses her assist skills in battle.

Currently this does not include when Rise blocks an attack or revives you. Only when giving buffs/healing. I'd like to look into adding a cutin for the block and revive later on though (see the [Issue](https://github.com/AnimatedSwine37/p4g64.riseCutin/issues/1) for this).

## Authors
While I (AnimatedSwine) wrote the code to display the cutins this mod wouldn't be what it is without the actual cutin file that you see in game. 
Big thanks to [BrawlerAce](https://gamebanana.com/members/2472258) and [muddye](https://gamebanana.com/members/3919847) who created the files that this mod includes, using Rise's cutin from P4AU as a base for the texture.
